# AxisGrabber

this a grabber for Axis 213 PTZ and Axis 207 w mjpeg streams.

Has been developed in 

Scovis (March 2008 - Feb 2011) FP7/2007-2013

by Dr Vasileios Anagnostopoulos

for ICCS/NTUA.

This is the original code made in 2010 as a proof of concept and used successfully.

It has to be ported to newer versions of Go (>= 1.5) and as a bonus feature it will have the correct time stamping(originating from camera).
